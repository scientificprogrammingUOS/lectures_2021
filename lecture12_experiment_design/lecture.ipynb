When `ExperimentHandler`s `nextEntry()` is called, the handler will go over to the next row.

    "In two experimental tasks, participants have to respond to a rectangle on the screen, according to its color (red or green), by pressing the left or the right arrow key on the computer’s keyboard. Additionally, the position of the rectangles can be either left or right. Each trial will start with the presentation of a fixation cross for 500 ms, ollowed by the rectangle that will remain on the display until a response is given. Between trials, a blank screen is shown for 3,000 ms. Each block will contain 128 trials in random order. The two tasks will differ only in the mapping of responses (i.e., which button to press for which color), which will be shown to the participant as a brief  nstruction at the beginning of each block. The order of tasks will be counterb alanced over participants. The experiment has a 2×2×2×2 factorial design, with the within-subjects  actors Color (red, green), Position (left, right), and Task (left = green, left = red), as well as the between-subjects factor Task Order (left = green first,left = red first).
